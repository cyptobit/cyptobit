### Cyptobit Network aims to be a Modular & Configurable DeData Infrastructure & Economy to feed Complete, Accurate & Validated Data to DeFi & all things Web3.0 
on Time & Reliably.

### Oracles have mainly been developed for Ethereum, price feeds, and Defi. Costs of running these architectures use gas and incur costs that are not practical, 
limiting the scope of what oracles can achieve. There is no legally binding agreement between consumers and providers of data. Consumers have to compromise between 
security, reliability, authenticity, and data delivery speed. There are barely any standards with regard to oracle safety and interoperability because 
the market has been monopolized with one vision from one selfish player.

### There is no transparency and traceability of data provenance. Users cannot choose the provenance of their data and how it is treated. There is no democratization 
of the data management process, and conflict resolution is tainted with poor voting technology. Incentives are not convincing people to participate.

### An oracle system cannot function without a strong DAO and conflict resolution mechanism. This is why Kylin is pushing toward the democratization of the data management
process with robust dispute resolution mechanisms and a voting system, which allows for assessing and strengthening the validity of a vote.

### There is no way to solve the oracle problem but giving a configurable framework for democratically creating and managing oracle system entities allows the consumer to 
evaluate and mitigate the risks while acting in full knowledge of the situation. A service level agreement (SLA) between the providers and consumers of data on the transparency 
and traceability of data provenance, specifying where the data came from, can offload some of the responsibility from the non-perfect performance of the oracle systems to the consumer. 
Never reaching perfection but striving for the best way to agglomerate data, cyptobit suggests a transparent multi-level oracle data agglomeration system allowing for a better balance of security, 
authenticity, persistency, and speed, also providing alternative fallbacks to help make the oracle data more reliable and resilient. To put this system in motion, cyptobit is proposing data feed 
ownership management with NFT and metadata as part of a strong and vibrant free Data market where the forces of capitalism can intertwine with ideals of a better life for everyone at a realistic 
operational cost.

### Just like robots are replacing our workforce, old ways of governing and doing business, which allow human nature to skew evolution, are going to fade out in favor of machine-based systems
which decentralize human activity where it is needed. From controlling the narrative to manipulating markets, these ”medieval institutions” are going to suffer the same fate as any organic system 
and be decentralized if need be by the driving force of evolution. Cyptobit is latching on to that force by bringing decentralized data to the masses.
